# Prefect

[[Prefect]] Prefect is an orchestrator for data-intensive workflows. It's the simplest way to transform any Python function into a unit of work that can be observed and orchestrated. With Prefect, you can build resilient, dynamic workflows that react to the world around them and recover from unexpected changes. With just a few decorators, Prefect supercharges your code with features like automatic retries, distributed execution, scheduling, caching, and much more. Every activity is tracked and can be monitored with the Prefect server or Prefect Cloud dashboard.
