# Polars
Polars is a DataFrame interface on top of an OLAP Query Engine implemented in Rust usingÂ [Apache Arrow Columnar Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)Â as the memory model.

## Installation
```python
pip install polars
```
## Features
- Lazy | eager execution
- Multi-threaded
- SIMD
- Query optimization
- Powerful expression API
- Hybrid Streaming (larger than RAM datasets)
- Rust | Python | NodeJS | R | ...
## Performance ðŸš€ðŸš€

### [](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars#blazingly-fast)Blazingly fast

Polars is very fast. In fact, it is one of the best performing solutions available. See the results inÂ [DuckDB's db-benchmark](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/).

In theÂ [TPCH benchmarks](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html)Â Polars is orders of magnitudes faster than pandas, dask, modin and vaex on full queries (including IO).

### [](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars#lightweight)Lightweight

Polars is also very lightweight. It comes with zero required dependencies, and this shows in the import times:

- polars: 70ms
- numpy: 104ms
- pandas: 520ms

### [](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars#handles-larger-than-ram-data)Handles larger than RAM data

If you have data that does not fit into memory, polars lazy is able to process your query (or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion, this drastically reduces memory requirements so you might be able to process your 250GB dataset on your laptop. Collect withÂ `collect(streaming=True)`Â to run the query streaming. (This might be a little slower, but it is still very fast!)

## Drawbacks
- NO distributed computing
